1. When using old versions of Intel MPI compilers (4.x), you might encounter the
following error message.

In file included from /opt/intel/impi/4.1.3/include/mpi.h(1279),
                 from ../lib/pnetcdf.h(10),
                 from ../../../trunk/src/libcxx/ncmpiType.h(2),
                 from ../../../trunk/src/libcxx/ncmpiType.cpp(2):
/opt/intel/impi/4.1.3/include/mpicxx.h(95): error: #error directive: "SEEK_SET is
#defined but must not be for the C++ binding of MPI. Include mpi.h before stdio.h"
#error "SEEK_SET is #defined but must not be for the C++ binding of MPI. Include mpi.h before stdio.h"
   ^

A solution is to add the following C++ preprocessor flags at the configure
command line, for example.

    ./configure CXXCPPFLAGS="-DMPICH_IGNORE_CXX_SEEK -DMPICH_SKIP_MPICXX"


Note that this error has been resolved when using newer Intel MPI
compiler (5.x).  See the two URLs below for more information.

2. If you encountered the following error when using mpiicc compiler, add
   "CPP="mpiicc -E"" to your configure command line should resolve the problem.

   configure: error: in pnetcdf-1.11.0': configure: error: C preprocessor "mpiicc" fails sanity check See config.log' for more details
