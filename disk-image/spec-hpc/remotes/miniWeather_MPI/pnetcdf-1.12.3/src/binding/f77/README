f2c files are now automatically generated in Makefile.


The fortran bindings are automatically generated from the C header file.
The script file, createffiles, that can be run to generate the C interface
files is borrowed from MPICH. It reads the input file, defs, that defines
the translation of Fortran arguments to C.

This is nifty, but not flawless.  Compilation under 'gcc -Wall' may produce
some warning messages.

To regenerate all C files, run command below:
   ./createffiles
