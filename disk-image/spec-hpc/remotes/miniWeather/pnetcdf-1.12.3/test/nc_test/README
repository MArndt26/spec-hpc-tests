This test is ported from Unidata netCDF-3.5 to test the functionality
of the PnetCDF API C interface particularly on a single processor.

The test programs have been modified and the typical way to run the test is:
(1) "<mpirun -np 1> ./nc_test -d output_folder"
    This command test files in CDF-1 format
(2) "<mpirun -np 1> ./nc_test -2 -d output_folder"
    This command test files in CDF-2 format
(3) "<mpirun -np 1> ./nc_test -5 -d output_folder"
    This command test files in CDF-5 format
