# This run script is based off the gem5/configs/example/gem5_library/x86-npb-benchmarks.py

# TODO: UPDATE THIS
"""
Script to run SPEC hpc 2021 benchmarks with gem5. The script expects the
benchmark program to run. The input is in the format
<benchmark_prog>.<class>.x .The system is fixed with 8 CPU cores, MESI
Two Level system cache and 3 GB DDR4 memory. It uses the x86 board.

This script will count the total number of instructions executed
in the ROI. It also tracks how much wallclock and simulated time.

Usage:
------

```
./gem5/build/X86/gem5.opt \
    x86-spec-hpc-benchmarks-from-src.py --command {command}
```
